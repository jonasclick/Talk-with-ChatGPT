# Talk with ChatGPT (Voice-Interactive)
This python code let's you actually talk with ChatGPT instead of typing.

It's amazing how ChatGPT responds almost like a real human, right?
But don't you feel like typing your question and then reading it's answer greatly worsens this feeling of having a real human assistant?

Yep, me too!

Introducing: Talk with ChatGPT. 
Now you can just speak to ChatGPT and listen to the answer. Like real humans do when they communicate.

What this Python Code does:  
– Listens to your prompt (audio recording)  
– Converts your voice-prompt into text (using OpenAI's Speech-To-Text)  
– Sends your (now written) prompt to ChatGPT (using OpenAI's API)  
– Gets an answer from ChatGPT (using OpenAI's API)  
– Turns the (written) answer into speech (using OpenAI's Text-To-Speech)  
– Plays the audio file


Using this, you can talk to ChatGPT in many languages. I personally tested English, German, French, Spanish and Thai. It works like a charm! For Thai it has a very american accent though xD

I find it tons of fun to use!
